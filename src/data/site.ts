  about: `I'm a third-year EHL student focused on finance, strategy, and consulting. My academic work centres on hotel asset management, real estate investment, and corporate finance — always with a bias toward rigour and practical application. Outside the classroom, I've held operational and analytical roles that sharpened my ability to work under pressure, manage stakeholders, and deliver clear recommendations.`,
